# Brand Manager — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=Brand Manager.

## Process

1. Read the content and Agent Log for context
2. Review against brand guidelines (voice, tone, messaging, positioning)
3. Log: `[Brand Manager - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Brand review complete. Verdict: Approved/Revise.` Include specific feedback.
4. If approved, move to Review (Owner=Human) or next step in pipeline
5. If revision needed, move back to Content Creator or Social Media Manager (Owner=appropriate agent) with specific feedback in Agent Log

## Standards

- Every rejection must include specific examples and suggestions
- Approvals should note what worked well (reinforces good patterns)
- Log brand decisions for future reference
