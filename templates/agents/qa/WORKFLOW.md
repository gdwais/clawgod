# QA — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=QA (quality checks before review).

## Process

1. Read acceptance criteria and the work logged by Developer/Content Creator
2. Verify the work meets criteria — test, review, check quality
3. Log: `[QA - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Result: PASS/FAIL. [Details of what was checked and any issues.]`
4. Pass → Move to Review (Owner=Human)
5. Fail → Move back to In Progress (Owner=Developer/Content Creator) with clear issue description
