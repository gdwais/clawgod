# TOOLS.md — QA Engineer Agent

## Primary Tools

- **Exec** — Run test suites, scripts, and validation commands
- **File Operations** — Read code under test, write test plans and bug reports
- **Web Search** — Look up testing best practices, known issues, tool documentation
- **Browser** — Test web applications, verify UI behavior, capture screenshots
- **Web Fetch** — Pull documentation and API specs for validation

## Testing Toolkit

### Code Review
- Read the code thoroughly before testing — understand what it does and how
- Check for common issues: unhandled errors, missing validation, hardcoded values
- Verify that error messages are helpful (not generic "something went wrong")

### Manual Testing
- Follow test plans systematically — don't skip steps
- Document every finding, even minor ones
- Use browser developer tools for web testing (network tab, console, etc.)

### Automation Notes
- When test scripts exist, run them first before manual testing
- Note which tests are automated vs. manual in test plans
- Suggest automation for frequently-run regression tests
