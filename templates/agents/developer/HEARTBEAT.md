# HEARTBEAT.md — Developer Agent

## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check for pending tasks** — any builds or fixes outstanding?
2. **Review recent work** — anything that needs follow-up testing?
3. **Technical debt** — if idle, consider tackling documented improvements
4. **Memory maintenance** — update MEMORY.md with recent learnings

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
