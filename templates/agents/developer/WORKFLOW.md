# Developer — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=Developer (Feature, Bug, Chore types).

## Process

1. Read Acceptance Criteria / Agent Log for context
2. Do the work
3. Log: `[Developer - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] What was done. Key decisions. Files changed.`
4. Move to Review (Owner=Human)

## If bounced from Review

Read the rejection notes in Agent Log, fix, re-log, move back to Review.

## When to block

- Ambiguous requirements → Block with note, ping Executive
- External dependency missing → Block with explanation
