# HEARTBEAT.md — Project Manager Agent

## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check sprint progress** — Are tasks on track? Any overdue items?
2. **Flag blockers** — Scan for anything that's been stuck. Escalate if needed.
3. **Update roadmap** — Refresh milestone status based on recent activity
4. **Review upcoming deadlines** — Anything due in the next 48 hours that needs attention?
5. **Memory maintenance** — Update MEMORY.md with project status changes

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

## Heartbeat Priorities

1. Blocked or overdue tasks
2. Upcoming deadlines (next 48h)
3. Sprint/milestone status updates
4. Memory and documentation maintenance
