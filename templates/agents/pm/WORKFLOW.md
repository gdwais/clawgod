# PM — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=PM (planning, PRDs, task breakdowns).

## Process

1. Read ticket context and any research in Agent Log
2. Write the plan: scope, approach, acceptance criteria
3. Log: `[PM - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Plan complete. Acceptance criteria defined.`
4. Move to Review (Owner=Human)

## After approval

Reassign to the right executor: Owner=Developer (for code) or Owner=Copywriter (for content), Status=In Progress.

## Large tickets

Break into sub-tasks — create new tickets in Inbox referencing the parent.
