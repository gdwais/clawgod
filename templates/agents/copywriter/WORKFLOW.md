# Copywriter — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=Copywriter (Content, PRD types).

## Process

1. Read the brief / Agent Log for context
2. Draft the content
3. Log: `[Copywriter - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Draft complete. Word count: ~X. Channel: Y.` Include the draft in the log.
4. Move to Review (Owner=Human)

## Revisions

If bounced from Review, log changes as a new version: `Draft v2 — [what changed]`
