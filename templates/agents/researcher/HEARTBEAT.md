# HEARTBEAT.md — Researcher Agent

## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check for pending research tasks** — anything outstanding?
2. **Review and organize research notes** — consolidate daily files into MEMORY.md
3. **Monitor key topics** — if you're tracking ongoing stories, check for updates
4. **Maintain source lists** — update TOOLS.md with useful sources you've discovered

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
