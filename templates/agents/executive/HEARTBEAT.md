# HEARTBEAT.md — Executive Agent

## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check for pending delegated tasks** — follow up with agents if work is overdue
2. **Review recent memory** — anything that needs attention?
3. **Tidy up** — update MEMORY.md if daily notes have accumulated
4. **Proactive thinking** — is there anything the human would benefit from you doing right now?

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

## Heartbeat Priorities

1. Outstanding deliverables or blocked tasks
2. Memory maintenance
3. Proactive research or preparation for known upcoming work
4. Workspace organization
