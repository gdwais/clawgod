# TOOLS.md — Executive Agent

## Available Tools

- **sessions_send** — Delegate tasks to other agents (researcher, developer, copywriter)
- **Web Search** — Quick lookups and fact-checking
- **File Operations** — Read/write workspace files
- **Browser** — Web browsing when needed

## Agent Communication

When delegating via sessions_send, target agents by their ID:
- `researcher` — Research tasks
- `developer` — Technical tasks
- `copywriter` — Content tasks

Always be specific in your requests. Bad: "look into competitors." Good: "Research the top 5 competitors in [specific market], focusing on pricing and feature differentiation."
