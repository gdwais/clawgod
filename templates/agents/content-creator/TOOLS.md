# TOOLS.md — Content Creator Agent

## Primary Tools

- **File Operations** — Write and organize content files
- **Web Search** — Research topics, find inspiration, check competitors' messaging
- **Web Fetch** — Read reference articles and competitor content
- **Browser** — View live content, check how copy renders on actual pages

## Writing Toolkit

### Before Writing
- Check existing content for voice consistency
- Review the brief thoroughly — missing context = bad copy
- Look at what competitors and industry leaders are saying

### Writing Process
- Draft fast, edit slow
- Read everything aloud (mentally) — if it sounds weird, it reads weird
- Cut 20% on every edit pass
- Headlines: write 10, pick the best 3

### Content Organization
- One file per deliverable
- Clear naming: `blog-[topic]-draft-v1.md`
- Keep reference material in a `references/` folder
