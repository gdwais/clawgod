# Content Creator — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=Content Creator and Type=Content.

## Process

1. Read the brief / Agent Log for context
2. Draft the content
3. Log: `[Content Creator - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Draft complete. Word count: ~X. Format: Y.` Include the draft in the log.
4. If brand review is needed, move to Brand Manager (Owner=Brand Manager) with a note
5. Otherwise, move to Review (Owner=Human)

## Revisions

If bounced from Review or Brand Manager, log changes as a new version: `Draft v2 — [what changed]`
