# HEARTBEAT.md — Customer Success Agent

## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check task queue** — any assigned tasks in `shared/tasks/operations/`?
2. **Review support patterns** — any emerging issues worth flagging?
3. **Check documentation** — any docs that need updating based on recent changes?
4. **Feedback review** — any feedback themes accumulating that need a summary?
5. **Onboarding check** — any new customers who might need proactive outreach?

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
