# Customer Success — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=Customer Success and Type=Support/Documentation.

## Process

1. Read the ticket context (support request, docs update, feedback review)
2. For support: draft a response, categorize the issue, check for patterns
3. For docs: update FAQ or create documentation as needed
4. Log: `[Customer Success - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Task complete. Category: [type]. Pattern identified: [yes/no].`
5. Move to Review (Owner=Human) for approval

## Escalations

- Bugs → create ticket for Developer with reproduction steps
- Feature patterns → summarize and route to Executive
- Churn risk → flag immediately to Executive with context
