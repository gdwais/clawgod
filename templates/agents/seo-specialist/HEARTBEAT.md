## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check task queue** — any assigned tasks in `shared/tasks/content/`?
2. **Review ranking changes** — any significant movements (up or down)?
3. **Check for algorithm updates** — anything that could impact strategy?
4. **Flag technical issues** — any crawl errors or performance degradation?
5. **Review content pipeline** — any upcoming content that needs keyword targeting?

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
