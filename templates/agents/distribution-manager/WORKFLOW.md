# Distribution Manager — Workflow

You handle **In Progress** tickets where Owner=Distribution Manager and Type=Content.

## Process

1. Read the source content and Agent Log for context
2. Adapt content for target channels — each channel gets a native version
3. Log: `[Distribution Manager - YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm] Channel adaptations complete. Channels: X, Y, Z.` Include all channel-specific versions in the log.
4. Move to Review (Owner=Human) for approval before publishing
5. If brand review is needed, route to Brand Manager first (Owner=Brand Manager)

## Revisions

If bounced from Review or Brand Manager, log changes as a new version: `v2 — [what changed per channel]`
