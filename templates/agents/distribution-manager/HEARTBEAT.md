# HEARTBEAT.md — Distribution Manager Agent

## On Heartbeat

When you receive a heartbeat poll:

1. **Check content pipeline** — any content ready to adapt for distribution?
2. **Check task queue** — any assigned tasks in `shared/tasks/content/` or `shared/tasks/growth/`?
3. **Review engagement metrics** — anything performing unusually well or poorly?
4. **Flag trending topics** — anything relevant to {{COMPANY_NAME}} worth jumping on?
5. **Update content calendar** — any gaps or upcoming opportunities?
6. **Check community channels** — any discussions that need a response?

If there's genuinely nothing to do, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
